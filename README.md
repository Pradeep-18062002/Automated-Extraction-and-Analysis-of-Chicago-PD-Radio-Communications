# Chicago Police Radio Communications Automation

This project automates the real-time extraction of audio files from the Chicago Police Departmentâ€™s radio communications using data provided by OpenMHz. The workflow leverages Python and Selenium to ensure timely data capture and efficient processing for further analysis.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks newly posted audio files on OpenMHz for immediate detection.
- **Automated Downloads**: Automatically captures audio files as they are uploaded to the platform.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust mechanisms to handle interruptions and ensure workflow continuity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- Google Chrome or compatible browser
- ChromeDriver (matching the browser version)



1. Download the appropriate version of [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) and place it in the project directory.

2. Configure the script:
   - Update the OpenMHz URL and any necessary parameters in the configuration file.

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements

- **Audio-to-Text Conversion**: Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to transcribe audio files into text for actionable insights.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Develop a system to send real-time alerts to people in the surrounding areas based on analyzed content.
